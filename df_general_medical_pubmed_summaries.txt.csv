1,38087479,"hepatitis a is a common cause of acute infectious hepatitis in children, transmitted through the faeco-oral route. although mostly self-limiting, cholestasis is a rare but known complication of acute hepatitis a in children. this report presents an adolescent girl who developed cholestatic features following hepatitis a infection and successful treatment with oral steroid therapy. prolonged cholestasis jaundice (pcj) is a known manifestation of hepatitis a infection, characterised by prolonged fever, pruritus and jaundice. while the exact mechanisms causing pcj are not fully understood, immunological-mediated responses could play a role. treatment options for pcj are limited, and there is no currently accepted standard of care. steroids have shown promise in treating pcj, as observed in this case and a few other reported cases. when other therapies fail to alleviate symptoms, corticosteroids should be considered as a potential treatment option. however, further studies are required to conclusively establish their efficacy."
2,38087466,"the female mosquito is endowed with the responsibility of gene transfer from one generation to another through careful delivery of her eggs to an appropriate environment. to guarantee a successful reproduction process, female mosquitoes use an evaluative approach to select an oviposition site that will ensure that their progeny successfully hatch and develop from larvae to pupa to adult. specific conditions must be met during oviposition site selection before gravid females deposit eggs, including but not limited to appropriate temperature, salinity, and ph; the presence of nutrition; and a low risk of predation. mosquito species exhibit a remarkable diversity in their oviposition site selection behaviors. for instance, <i>aedes aegypti</i>, which is a vector for zika, dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses, prefers to lay its eggs in natural depressions (e.g., tree holes) or artificial containers. in contrast, other mosquito species, like <i>anopheles</i>, gravitate toward more open water bodies. understanding the oviposition preference behavior of the <i>ae. aegypti</i> mosquito will facilitate the development of surveillance and control efforts to hinder the successful progression of this vector. here, we present information on some of the known behaviors and preferences of <i>ae. aegypti</i> during oviposition site selection, techniques to measure these preferences, and some open questions."

12,38087014,"traditionally, the clinical evaluation of respiratory diseases was pulmonary function testing, which can be used for the detection of severity and prognosis through pulmonary function parameters. however, this method is limited by the complex process, which is impossible for patients to monitor daily. in order to evaluate pulmonary function parameters conveniently with less time and location restrictions, cough sound is the substitute parameter. in this paper, 371 cough sounds segments from 150 individuals were separated into 309 and 62 as the training and test samples. short-time fourier transform (stft) was applied to transform cough sound into spectrogram, and resnet50 model was used to extract 2048-dimensional features. through support vector regression (svr) model with biological attributes, the data were regressed with pulmonary function parameters, fev1, fev1%, fev1/fvc, fvc, fvc%, and the performance of this models was evaluated with fivefold cross-validation. combines with deep learning and machine learning technologies, the better results in the case of small samples were achieved. using the coefficient of determination (r<sup>2</sup>), the resnet50 + svr model shows best performance in five basic pulmonary function parameters evaluation as fev1(0.94), fev1%(0.84), fev1/fvc(0.68), fvc(0.92), and fvc%(0.72). this resnet50 + svr hybrid model shows excellent evaluation of pulmonary function parameters during coughing, making it possible to realize a simple and rapid evaluation for pneumonia patients. the technology implemented in this paper is beneficial in judge the patient's condition, realize early screening of respiratory diseases, evaluate postoperative disease changes and detect respiratory infectious diseases without time and location restrictions."
13,38084167,"background coronaviruses are viral agents that commonly infect animals, but have the ability to cause respiratory illness in humans, exemplified by the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak (covid-19). due to the sparse literature on the effects of covid-19 on the respiratory system, and the possible development of persistent asthma-like symptoms after infection, this cross-sectional analysis was performed in order to compare the clinical and investigative parameters between post-covid patients and asthmatic patients. methods a retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with prior history of covid-19 infection that presented to the pulmonology or respiratory outpatient clinics with asthma-like symptoms and were subsequently compared to known asthmatic patients with absent history of prior covid-19 infection, in order to evaluate the degree of similarity between both cohorts. in this study, asthma-like symptoms were defined as: (i) cough, (ii) wheezing, (iii) chest tightness, and (iv) shortness of breath. moreover, comparisons of investigative parameters were also performed, including (i) fractional exhaled nitric oxide (feno), (ii) serum immunoglobulin e (ige), (iii) absolute eosinophil counts, and (iv) qualitative spirometry results. all statistical analyses were conducted via chi-squared testing for categorical variables, and independent t-test for continuous variables. results in this study, there were a total of 76 patients included that conformed to the eligibility criteria, including 39 patients with post-covid symptoms with absent history of asthma or other respiratory illnesses, and 37 patients with known asthma with absent history of prior covid-19 infection or other respiratory illnesses. overall, this study revealed the similarities between both cohorts with respect to the incidence of cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. moreover, there were similarities between the serum ige and spirometry results. however, there were differences within the complaint of wheeze, feno values, and eosinophil counts between both cohorts. the placement of post-covid patients on bronchodilator therapy involving inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists revealed improvement in all follow-up patients. conclusion in conclusion, there was considerable similarity in the complaint of asthma-like symptoms after covid-19 infection, associated with an improvement after the use of bronchodilator therapy, indicating the potential role of anti-asthma therapy (e.g., bronchodilator therapy) in managing post-covid asthma-like symptoms. in order to validate our conclusion, further comprehensive studies with robust methodologies and larger sample populations are encouraged."
14,38083528,"pneumonia is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children. this is especially true in resource poor regions lacking diagnostic facilities, bringing about the need for rapid diagnostic tests for pneumonia. cough is a common symptom of acute respiratory diseases, including pneumonia, and the sound of cough can be indicative of the pathological variations caused by respiratory infections. as such, in this paper we study objective cough sound evaluation for differentiating between pneumonia and other acute respiratory diseases. we use a dataset of 491 cough sounds from 173 children diagnosed either as having pneumonia or other acute respiratory diseases. we extract features which describe the temporal, spectral, and cepstral characteristics of the cough sound. these features are combined with feature embeddings from a pretrained deep learning network and used to train a multilayer perceptron for classification. the proposed method achieves a sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 73% respectively in differentiating between pneumonia and other acute respiratory diseases using cough sounds alone."
15,38083513,"the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) infection is fast becoming one of the most significant infections worldwide. of all the causes of sars-cov-2 infection, airborne-droplet infection via coughing is the most common. therefore, if predicting the onset of a cough and preventing infection were possible, it would have a globally positive impact. here, we describe a new prediction and prevention system for sars-cov-2 infection. usually, air is inhaled prior to coughing, and the cough, which contains droplets of the virus, then occurs during acute exhalation. therefore, if we can predict the onset of a cough, we can prevent the spread of sars-cov-2. at tohoku university, a diagnosis system for evaluating swallowing motions and peripheral circulation has already been developed, and our prediction system can be integrated into this system. using three-dimensional human body imaging, we developed a prediction system for preempting the onset of a cough. if we can predict the onset a cough, we can prevent the spread of sars-cov-2 infection, by decreasing the shower of virally active airborne droplets. here, we describe the newly developed prediction and prevention system for sars-cov-2 infection that preempts the onset of a cough.clinical relevance- if predicting the onset of a cough and preventing infection were possible, it would have a globally positive impact. here, we describe the newly developed prediction and prevention system for sars-cov-2 infection."
16,38088021,"vanillin is a flavouring agent that is prohibited for use in infant food products with ages lower than 6 months. excessive vanillin usage could lead to eating disorders, nausea, headache, and vomiting. therefore, it is essential to control the contents of vanillin in food samples, especially in infant formula. here, we developed a highly sensitive nanosensor for vanillin based on using green synthesized highly fluorescent (qy = 29.5%) n-doped carbon quantum dots (n-cqds) as a turn-off fluorescent nanoprobe. the n-doped cqds synthesis was adopted using citrus bulb squeeze extract and the commonly used fertilizer, urea, as substrates. after mixing with vanillin, the fluorescence of the n-cqds was largely quenched in a vanillin concentration-dependent manner. the sensing conditions were optimized by quality-by-design using a two-level full factorial design (2<sup>2</sup> ffd). the n-doped cqds could detect vanillin in the range 0.1-12.0 μg/ml with a limit of detection of 0.013 μg/ml. next, a smartphone imaging-based assay combined with a uv chamber was adopted and applied for vanillin determination. this simple detection technique showed sensitivity similar to that of the conventional fluorimetric method. both conventional and smartphone-based methods were successfully applied for the determination of vanillin in infant milk formula and biscuits and could detect real vanillin concentrations in the analyzed samples with high % recoveries (94.5% to 105.5%). at last, the biocompatibility of the newly synthesized n-cqds was tested, and it was found to be an excellent candidate for cancer cell imaging."
