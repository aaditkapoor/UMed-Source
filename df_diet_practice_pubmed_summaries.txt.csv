0,38088191,"in recent decades, the patient survival is increased due to advances in intensive care units and development of modern mechanic ventilators. unfortunately, it is not always possible to wean these children from mechanical ventilation. recently, after placement a tracheostomy tube, these children can be supported at home with noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. most of the children who need ventilation support at home have neurological impairment. the nutritional issues and gastrointestinal (gi) complications are well defined in critically ill patients, but there are very limited studies on children with tracheostomy. considering that majority of the patients have neuromuscular disorders, the nutritional and gi problems of the children with tracheostomy are discussed in light of the knowledge of critically ill patients."
1,38088115,"objective    the prognostic nutritional index (pni) is a practical, applicable, prognostic scoring system. however, its clinical significance in unprotected left main coronary artery (ulmca) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) has not yet been clarified. this study aimed to examine the relationship between malnutrition as assessed by pni and major adverse cardiac events (mace) in ulmca patients undergoing pci.material and methods    185 patients who were hospitalized in our clinic underwent coronary angiography, had a critical lmca lesion, and underwent angiography-guided pci were included. the study population was divided into tertiles based on the pni values. a high pni (n=142) was defined as a value in the third tertile (≥ 34.0), and a low pni (n=43) was defined as a value in the lower 2 tertiles (&lt; 34.0). the primary endpoint was mace.results    mace and mortality rates in the low pni group were significantly higher compared to the high pni group (51 % vs. 30 %, p=0.009; 44 % vs. 20 %, p=0.002, respectively). high pni (hr:1.902; 95 % ci:1.112-3.254; p=0.019), previous stroke (hr:3.025; 95 % ci:1.038-8.810; p=0.042) and syntax score (hr:1.028; 95 % ci:1.004-1.057, p=0.023) were independent predictors of mace in the multivariable cox regression analyzes.conclusions    in patients undergoing ulmca pci, nutritional status can be considered an indicator of mace rates by evaluating the pni score. this index can be used for risk classification."
2,38088063,"the origins of alzheimer's disease (ad) and parkinson's disease (pd) involve genetic mutations, epigenetic changes, neurotoxin exposure and gut microbiota dysregulation. the gut microbiota's dynamic composition and its metabolites influence intestinal and blood-brain barrier integrity, contributing to ad and pd development. this review explores protein misfolding, aggregation and epigenetic links in ad and pd pathogenesis. it also highlights the role of a leaky gut and the microbiota-gut-brain axis in promoting these diseases through inflammation-induced epigenetic alterations. in addition, we investigate the potential of diet, probiotics and microbiota transplantation for preventing and treating ad and pd via epigenetic modifications, along with a discussion related to current challenges and future considerations. these approaches offer promise for translating research findings into practical clinical applications."

4,38087937,"frailty is a key element in healthy ageing in which muscle performance plays a main role. beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (hmb) supplementation has shown favourable effects in modulating protein synthesis, improving muscle mass and function in interventional studies. decreased age-related endogenous hmb levels have been shown in previous studies. the aim of the present study is to assess whether there is an association between endogenous plasma hmb levels and frailty."
5,38087927,"balanced energy protein (bep) supplementation is an efficacious intervention in pregnancy for improving birthweight and is recommended by world health organization (who) in countries with high maternal undernutrition. few countries have implemented bep programmes due in part to high cost, lack of data on acceptability and feasibility, and complexity of delivery. we sought to address implementation gaps in bep interventions through a formative study designed to understand implementation outcomes. we conducted 52 in-depth interviews and 8 focus-group discussions with married women of reproductive age, family members, health care providers and pharmacists in three unions of the gaibandha district in rural bangladesh. interviews were translated and transcribed in english and analysed using an analytic framework for implementation science in nutrition. bep was viewed as an acceptable and appropriate intervention to combat undernutrition in this setting. there was a lack of clarity on who should or could be responsible for providing/distributing bep in a way convenient to mothers. many participants preferred door-to-door delivery and thought this approach could address social and gender inequities, but providers mentioned already being overworked and worried about adding new tasks. participants were concerned about the affordability of bep and opportunity costs associated with travel to proposed distribution sites such as anc or pharmacies. women in these communities do not always have the agency to travel without supervision or make purchasing decisions. bep supplementation is a complex intervention; future trials seek to assess ways to overcome these implementation challenges and inform a long-term systems-owned bep intervention."

7,38087805,"sickle cell disease (scd) is associated with high rates of undernutrition and stunting. undernutrition in combination with chronic haemolysis may lead to deficiencies in micronutrients necessary for erythropoiesis. here we examined selected levels of ferritin, vitamins b<sub>2</sub> , b<sub>6</sub> , b<sub>9</sub> and b<sub>12</sub> , and vitamin c that were measured in blood samples from 820 scd patients from tanzania with no history of hospital admission, infections or painful episodes in the previous 30 days. we studied children (0-8 years), early adolescents (9-14 years), late adolescents (15-17 years) and adults (≥18 years). severely low levels of vitamin b<sub>12</sub> were observed across the four age groups. despite the lowered vitamin b<sub>12</sub> concentrations, total homocysteine concentrations were normal across both genders in all age groups. we found no significant gender-related differences between the other measured micronutrients. in this large scd population, spanning the whole life cycle, a low level of vitamin b<sub>12</sub> was consistently found across both genders and all age groups. given the pivotal role of vitamin b<sub>12</sub> in cellular metabolism, particularly in erythropoiesis, more studies are required to unravel how to better detect clinically relevant vitamin b<sub>12</sub> deficiency among scd patients, and thus to identify more precisely those who need supplementation of vitamin b<sub>12</sub> ."
8,38068870,"nutrition-related chronic diseases are a major problem among indigenous populations. appropriate dietary intake assessment tools are needed for nutritional surveillance and intervention; however, tools designed to measure the habitual dietary intake of indigenous persons are largely lacking. we developed a digital food frequency questionnaire (ffq) to measure habitual consumption among australian aboriginal adults and support personalized nutrition counseling. the primary contributors to energy, select nutrients, and inter-person variation (83 food groups) were identified from nationally representative 24 h recall (24hr) data, and they accounted for >80% of the total intake and inter-person variation of the nutrients of interest. based on community input, a meal-based ffq format was adopted, with a main food/beverage list of 81 items and the capacity to report on >300 additional items via the digital platform. the nutrient database was based on the australian food and nutrient database. data for the first 60 study participants (70% female; median age: 48 years) were used to assess the ffq's utility. the participants' median [iqr] reported energy intake (10,042 [6968-12,175] kj/day) was similar to their median [iqr] estimated energy expenditure (10,197 [8636-11,551] kj/day). foods/beverages on the main ffq list accounted for between 66% and 90% of the participants' reported energy and nutrient intakes; the remainder came from participant-selected extra items. the digital ffq platform provides a potentially valuable resource for monitoring habitual dietary intake among aboriginal adults and supporting chronic disease prevention and management interventions."

10,38057600,"cellulite is a common esthetic concern affecting most women. despite its prevalence, there is no consensus on the optimal treatment approach for cellulite, partly due to the complex and multifactorial nature of its pathophysiology. understanding the underlying biological processes along with available treatment options is important to be able to effectively counsel patients on effective management of this condition. this review aims to focus on high-quality evidence behind pathophysiology of cellulite, severity and grading, and its available treatment options."
11,38057042,malnutrition is common in older individuals with end-stage renal disease on maintenance dialysis. whether nutritional supplementation may improve skeletal muscle mass (smm) and survival rate in this population is uncertain. we aimed to analyze the effect of a year of nutritional supplementation on muscle mass and survival rate in older patients on hemodiafiltration.
12,38053746,"many studies report poor adherence to sports nutrition guidelines, but there is a lack of research on the effectiveness of nutrition education and behavior change interventions in athletes. some studies among athletes demonstrate that nutrition education (ne), often wrongly confused with nutritional counseling (nc), alone is insufficient to result in behavior change. for this reason, a clear distinction between nc and ne is of paramount importance, both in terms of definition and application. ne is considered a formal process to improve a client's knowledge about food and physical activity. nc is a supportive process delivered by a qualified professional who guides the client(s) to set priorities, establish goals, and create individualized action plans to facilitate behavior change. nc and ne can be delivered both to individuals and groups. to our knowledge, the efficacy of nc provided to athletes has not been comprehensively reviewed. the aim of this study was to investigate the current evidence on the use and efficacy of nutritional counseling within athletes. a systematic literature review was performed based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses method. the search was carried out in: pubmed, scopus, web of science, science direct, cochrane library between november 2022 and february 2023. inclusion criteria: recreational and elite athletes; all ages; all genders; nc strategies. the risk of bias was assessed using the rob 2.0 cochrane tool. the quality of evidence checking was tested with the mixed methods appraisal tool system. from 2,438 records identified, 10 studies were included in this review, with athletes representing different levels of competition and type of sports. the most commonly applied behavior change theory was cognitive behavioral theory. nc was delivered mainly by nutrition experts. the duration of the intervention ranged from 3 weeks to 5 years. regarding the quality of the studies, the majority of articles reached more than 3 stars and lack of adequate randomization was the domain contributing to high risk of bias. nc interventions induced positive changes in nutrition knowledge and dietary intake consequently supporting individual performance. there is evidence of a positive behavioral impact when applying nc to athletes, with positive effects of nc also in athletes with eating disorders. additional studies of sufficient rigor (i.e., randomized controlled trials) are needed to demonstrate the benefits of nc in athletes."

25,38086241,"conventional topoisomerase (topo) inhibitors typically usually exert their cytotoxicity by damaging the dnas, which exhibit high toxicity and tend to result in secondary carcinogenesis risk. molecules that have potent topoisomerase inhibitory activity but involve less dna damage provide more desirable scaffolds for developing novel chemotherapeutic agents. in this work, we broke the rigid pentacyclic system of luotonin a and synthesized thirty-three compounds as potential topo inhibitors based on the devised molecular motif. further investigation disclose that two compounds with the highest antiproliferation activity against cancer cells, 5aa and 5dd, had a distinct topo i inhibitory mechanism different from those of the classic topo i inhibitors cpt or luteolin, and were able to obviate the obvious cellular dna damage typically associated with clinically available topo inhibitors. the animal model experiments demonstrated that even in mice treated with a high dosage of 50 mg/kg 5aa, there were no obvious signs of toxicity or loss of body weight. the tumor growth inhibition (tgi) rate was 54.3 % when 20 mg/kg 5aa was given to the t24 xenograft mouse model, and 5aa targeted the cancer tissue precisely without causing damage to the liver and other major organs."

28,38086922,"the prevalence of obesity and associated chronic diseases continues to increase worldwide, negatively impacting on societies and economies. whereas the association between excess body weight and increased risk for developing a multitude of diseases is well established, the initiating mechanisms by which weight gain impairs our metabolic health remain surprisingly contested. in order to better address the myriad of disease states associated with obesity, it is essential to understand adipose tissue dysfunction and develop strategies for reinforcing adipocyte health. in this review we outline the diverse physiological functions and pathological roles of human white adipocytes, examining our current knowledge of why white adipocytes are vital for systemic metabolic control, yet poorly adapted to our current obesogenic environment."
29,38086826,"the reduction of nitrogen (n) and phosphorus (p) in fattening pigs' diets is one possible approach to lower n and p excretion in livestock farming relative to n and p intake. due to the implementation of the european nitrates directive and the consecutive amendments to the german fertiliser legislation since 2017, <i>n</i>- and <i>p</i>-reduced diets for fattening pigs are becoming more and more important and are increasingly used in practice. to investigate the effects of such diets on n and p balance and retention as well as on nutrient digestibility of contemporary fattening pigs, a balance experiment was performed with eight barrows (average live weight = 61.5 ± 2.1 kg) which were surgically fitted with a simple t-cannula at the terminal ileum. the pigs received a control diet meeting nutrient requirements (con) and an <i>n</i>- and <i>p</i>-reduced diet (npred) <i>ad libitum</i> (<i>n</i> = 4/diet) in a 3-phased feeding regimen (3 weeks/phase). in the last week of each phase, faeces and urine were collected quantitatively for 5 days followed by a 2 × 12 hours collection of ileal digesta. daily feed intake, live weight gain and feed-to-gain ratio did not differ between con and npred. npred-fed pigs consumed 10.5% (<i>p</i> = 0.006) and excreted 28.3% (<i>p</i> = 0.028) less n than con-fed pigs. phosphorus excretion was lowered by 15.1% in npred-fed pigs (<i>p</i> = 0.012). n and p retention did not differ between con and npred, but were elevated in comparison to other studies. n and p efficiency, expressed as nutrient retention divided by nutrient intake, was higher in npred - than con-fed pigs (n: 68 vs 60%, p: 54.2 vs 49.3%). apparent post-ileal digestibility coefficient (dc<sub>post-ileal</sub>) and apparent total tract digestibility coefficient (dc<sub>total</sub>) of crude protein were higher in npred - than con-fed pigs (<i>p</i> < 0.013), but apparent precaecal digestibility coefficient (dc<sub>pc</sub>) of crude protein was unaffected by diet. dc<sub>pc</sub>, dc<sub>post-ileal</sub> and dc<sub>total</sub> of p were similar for con- and npred-fed pigs. npred-fed pigs showed an elevated dc<sub>pc</sub> and dc<sub>total</sub> of organic matter, n-free-extractives and starch compared to con-fed pigs. dc<sub>pc</sub> of calcium was also higher in npred-fed pigs. in conclusion, the results suggest that <i>n</i>- and <i>p</i>-reduced feeding of fattening pigs remains an effective strategy to lower the n and p release into the environment. furthermore, results indicate that <i>n</i>- and <i>p</i>-reduced feeding leads to a higher n and p efficiency in contemporary fattening pigs."
30,38086615,it is crucial to reduce the high sugar content of fruit yoghurts in response to the excessive weight gain epidemic. the use of alternative sweeteners in yoghurts is often associated with the negative sensory attributes that can have an impact on yoghurt liking. the main objective of this research was to investigate the effect of alternative sweeteners and strawberry puree addition on the temporal sensory profile of yoghurt using multiple-intake temporal check all that apply (tcata). a novel approach to the statical analysis of the temporal sensory data was employed by using aligned rank transformation (art)-anova to investigate the differences between sensory attributes within different product and within different intakes.
31,38086441,"environmental chemicals, such as plasticizers, have been linked to increased rates of obesity, according to epidemiological studies. acetyl triethyl citrate (atec) is a plasticizer that is commonly utilized in pharmaceutical products and food packaging as a non-phthalate alternative. due to its direct contact with the human body and high leakage rate from the polymers, assessment of the potential risk of atec exposure at environmentally relevant low doses to human health is needed. male c57bl/6 j mice were fed diets containing atec at doses of either 0.1 or 10 μg/kg per day in a period of 12 weeks to mimic the real exposure environment. the findings suggest that in c57bl/6 j mice, atec exposure resulted in increased body weight gain, body fat percentage, and benign hepatocytes, as well as adipocyte size. consistent with in vivo models, atec treatment obviously stimulated the increase of intracellular lipid load in both mouse and human hepatocytes. mechanically, atec induced the transcriptional expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis and lipid uptake. using both enzyme inhibitor and small interfering rna (sirna) transfection, we found that stearoyl-coenzyme a desaturase 1 (scd1) played a significant role in atec-induced intracellular lipid accumulation. this study for the first time provided initial evidence suggesting the obesogenic and fatty liver-inducing effect of atec at low doses near human exposure levels, and atec might be a potential environmental obesogen and its effect on human health need to be further evaluated."

33,38086169,"during the perimenopause, estrogen concentrations gradually decrease, and this is associated with changes to women's energy expenditure and intake. these changes result in weight gain and altered body fat distribution, with increased abdominal fat deposition and cardiometabolic risk via insulin resistance. body composition analysis is a useful clinical tool in outpatient settings, as it is simple, not expensive and provides information on body mass index, skeletal mass, fat mass, fat percentage and basal metabolic rate. this review discusses body composition analysis as part of a health assessment for healthy women during the perimenopause and investigates the associations between body composition and cardiometabolic profile."
34,38085408,"eating disorders frequently accompany autism spectrum disorder (asd). one such novel eating disorder is avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (arfid). this study compares the eating attitudes, quality of life, and sensory processing of typically developing children (tdc), autistic children, and autistic children with arfid. a total of 111 children aged 4-10 with a diagnosis of asd and arfid (n = 37), asd without arfid (n = 37), and typical development (n = 37) were recruited. after an interview in which childhood autism rating scale (cars) was administered, child eating behavior questionnaire (cebq), pediatric quality of life inventory (pedsql), social responsiveness scale (srs) and sensory profile (sp) were completed by caregivers. autistic children with arfid had higher scores in cebq subscales relating to low appetite and lower scores on the subscales associated with weight gain. both groups of autistic children scored lower than tdc on all pedsql subscales and autistic children with arfid had lower social ql scores than both groups. srs scores were highest in autistic children with arfid, followed by autistic and typically developing children. cars scores were similar in both groups of autistic children, but higher than tdc. auditory, vision, touch, multi-sensory, oral processing scores; as well as all quadrant scores, were significantly lower in autistic children with arfid. oral sensory processing scores were found to be the most significant predictor of arfid comorbidity in asd and reliably predicted arfid in autistic children in the clinical setting. autistic children with arfid demonstrate differences in social functioning, sensory processing, eating attitudes, and quality of life compared to autistic and td children."
35,38088132,"octreotide lar is a long-acting somatostatin analogue (ssa) used in the management of metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (gep nets). it requires intramuscular (im) injection. missed im injections cause subcutaneous nodules (scns) on radiologic images. we reviewed the rates of scns in a real-world cohort of gep nets receiving octreotide lar and explored treatment outcomes. patients commencing octreotide lar between august 5, 2010 and march 8, 2018 at a single cancer center in canada were identified from pharmacy records. patients were included if they had a computed tomography (ct) scan performed at the time of progression and a preceding ct with pelvis included to enable assessment for the presence of nodules. fisher's exact test was used to examine predictors of scns, and kaplan-meier curves summarized differences in progression free (pfs) and overall survival (os) that were compared with log-rank tests. of 243 patients receiving octreotide lar, 45 had all required ct images available for central review. scns were found in 20/45 (44%) of patients on the last scan showing stable disease before progression and were numerically but not statistically more likely in females (or: 2.36, 95% ci: 0.66-8.29, p = .23). there was an increased risk of scns in patients with a skin-to-muscle distance >38 mm (the length of an octreotide lar needle) on ct (or: 5.09, 95% ci: 1.39-16.6, p = .018) and a trend toward increased risk in obese patients (or: 5.71, 95% ci: 1.26-23.4, p = .061). pfs (hr: 1.01, 95% ci: 0.56-1.78, p = .98) and os (hr: 0.86, 95% ci: 0.41-1.8, p = .70) was similar between those with/without scns. in conclusion, almost half of patients receiving octreotide lar had scns; however, missed administration of ssa did not appear to result in worse survival in this small study. factors such as sex, younger age skin-to-muscle distance, and obesity may affect scn development and should be considered when choosing an ssa."
36,38088108,"aim    to study the relationship of blood serum concentration of endocan with indexes of apoptosis and clinical and instrumental characteristics of patients with ischemic heart disease (ihd).material and methods    the study included 176 subjects (105 men and 71 women). 150 of them were diagnosed with ihd and 26 were healthy volunteers. anthropometric measurements, coronary angiography, echocardiography, duplex ultrasound scanning of extracranial parts of the brachiocephalic arteries were performed for all patients. concentrations of endocan (ng / ml), glucose (mmol / l), and apoptotic markers bcl-2 (ng / ml), bax (ng / ml), bcl-2 / bax, trail (pg / ml), and p53 (ng / ml) were measured in blood serum. patients were divided into groups based on their syntax scores: group 1 with moderate atherosclerotic lesions of the coronary arteries (ca) (score &lt; 22, 78 patients); group 2 with severe ca atherosclerosis (score 23-32, 37 patients); and group 3 with extremely severe ca lesions (score &gt;33, 35 patients). the control group consisted of healthy volunteers (26 subjects). all groups were age- and sex-matched. differences were considered statistically significant at p&lt;0.05.results    a correlation was found between endocan concentration and ihd severity (r=0.32, p&lt;0.001). in group 1, the median endocan concentration was 14.57 ng / ml [8.21; 23.66], in group 2, 19.34 ng / ml [8.425; 26.645], in group 3, 32.13 ng / ml [18.2; 39.12], and in the control group, 6.92 ng / ml [4.62; 9.18]. correlations of varying strength and significance were observed between the endocan concentration and a number of clinical and instrumental characteristics. endocan concentrations significantly differed in groups of patients with multifocal atherosclerosis (p&lt;0.01), angina pectoris (p&lt;0.01), a history of myocardial infarction (p&lt;0.001), and obesity (p&lt;0.05) from patients without these signs. also, a correlation was found between serum endocan concentration and apoptotic markers: trail (r= -0.448, p&lt;0.001); bcl-2 (r= -0.552, p&lt;0.001), bax (r= -0.519, p&lt;0.001), bcl-2 / bax (r= -0.576, p&lt;0.001) and p53 (r= -0.520, p &lt;0.001).conclusion    the study demonstrated a potential role of endocan as a promising biomarker for risk stratification, prognosis and therapeutic monitoring of ihd patients."
37,38088098,"the covid-19 pandemic is still an unresolved situation in thailand and worldwide at large. the purpose of this study was to interpret the impacts of covid-19 on the management of ankle fractures and their outcomes. a systematic search and review were performed in accordance with the prisma guideline based on the pubmed database. the search terms were 'ankle fracture' and 'covid'. from an initial search, a total of 29 abstracts were found and screened in accordance with the eligibility criteria. then, five articles were considered eligible papers for further review. this review investigated a total of 16,813 patients with ankle fractures, including 215 patients (1.27%) who were also covid-19-positive. according to our results, the incidence of ankle fractures showed a decrease during the pandemic. however, covid-positive ankle fracture patients demonstrated a higher prevalence of comorbidities, including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. covid-19 infection was a factor that delayed the operation and increased the length of hospital stay and adverse effects from the surgery. covid-19 infection affected the management of ankle fractures and their outcomes in terms of negative impacts such as delayed operation, increased length of hospital stay, and increased adverse effects from the surgery. outpatient surgery was recommended to solve some of these problems."

39,38087869,"diabetic cardiomyopathy is a serious complication of obesity with type 2 diabetes and is a major cause of mortality. metabolic surgery, such as duodenal-jejunal bypass (djb), can effectively improve diabetic cardiomyopathy; however, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. oxidative stress is one of the pivotal mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy. our objective was to investigate the effect and potential mechanisms of djb on oxidative stress in the heart of diabetic cardiomyopathy rats."
40,38087862,"weight bias toward patients in larger bodies is pervasive among health care providers and can negatively influence provider-patient communication, as well as patients' behavior and health outcomes. weight bias has historical roots that perpetuate thinness and whiteness as the cultural norm. although weight bias remains socially acceptable in us culture, contributing factors to an individual's body size are complex and multifactorial. providers and health care systems also consistently use body mass index (bmi) as an indicator of health status, despite its limitations and harmful effects in the clinical setting. this state of the science review presents 8 evidence-based strategies that demonstrate how to mitigate harm from weight bias and improve quality of care and health outcomes for patients living in larger bodies. person-centered approaches to care include (1) eliminating clinical recommendations to lose weight; (2) shifting from a focus on weight to health; (3) implementing a size and weight-inclusive approach; (4) engaging in weight bias self-evaluation; (5) creating a welcoming environment for patients of all sizes; (6) seeking permission and learning the patient's story; (7) using weight-inclusive language; and (8) re-evaluating clinical guidelines and policies based on bmi. midwives and other health care providers may benefit from training that re-imagines the delivery of health care to patients in larger bodies."
