2,38086910,"myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (minoca) has several possible underlying causes, including coronary microvascular dysfunction (cmd). early cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (cmr) is recommended, however cannot provide a diagnosis in 25% of cases. quantitative stress cmr perfusion mapping can identify cmd, however it is unknown if cmd is present during long-term follow-up of minoca patients. therefore, this study aimed to evaluate presence of cmd during long-term follow-up in minoca patients with an initial normal cmr scan. minoca patients from the second stockholm myocardial infarction with normal coronaries study (sminc-2), with a normal cmr scan at median 3 days after hospitalization were investigated with comprehensive cmr including stress perfusion mapping a median of 5 years after the index event, together with age- and sex-matched volunteers without symptomatic ischemic heart disease. cardiovascular risk factors, medication and symptoms of myocardial ischemia measured by the seattle angina questionnaire 7 (saq-7), were registered. in total, 15 patients with minoca and an initial normal cmr scan (59 ± 7 years old, 60% female), and 15 age- and sex-matched volunteers, underwent cmr. patients with minoca and an initial normal cmr scan had lower global stress perfusion compared to volunteers (2.83 ± 1.8 vs 3.53 ± 0.7 ml/min/g, p = 0.02). there were no differences in other cmr parameters, hemodynamic parameters, or cardiovascular risk factors, except for more frequent use of statins in the minoca patient group compared to volunteers. in conclusion, global stress perfusion is lower in minoca patients during follow-up, compared to age- and sex-matched volunteers, suggesting that cmd may be a possible pathophysiological mechanism in minoca.clinical trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct02318498. registered 2014-12-17."

7,38083048,"revascularization of chronic total occlusions (cto) is currently one of the most complex procedures in percutaneous coronary intervention (pci), requiring the use of specific devices and a high level of experience to obtain good results. once the clinical indication for extensive ischemia or angina uncontrolled with medical treatment has been established, the decision to perform coronary intervention is not simple, since this procedure has a higher rate of complications than non-pci percutaneous intervention, higher ionizing radiation doses and a lower success rate. however, cto revascularization has been shown to be helpful in symptomatic improvement of angina, reduction of ischemic burden, or improvement of ejection fraction. the aim of this work is to determine whether a model developed using deep learning techniques, and trained with angiography images, can better predict the likelihood of a successful revascularization procedure for a patient with a chronic total occlusion (cto) lesion in their coronary artery (measured as procedure success and the duration of time during which x-ray imaging technology is used to perform a medical procedure) than the scales traditionally used. as a preliminary approach, patients with right coronary artery cto will be included since they present standard angiographic projections that are performed in all patients and present less technical variability (duration, projection angle, image similarity) among them.the ultimate objective is to develop a predictive model to help the clinician in the decision to intervene and to analyze the performance in terms of predicting the success of the technique for the revascularization of chronic occlusions.clinical relevance- the development of a deep learning model based on the angiography images could potentially overcome the gold standard and help interventional cardiologists in the treatment decision for percutaneous coronary intervention, maximizing the success rate of coronary intervention."

37,38088109,"aim    to identify independent predictors associated with in-hospital atrial fibrillation (af) following coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg).material and methods     the study included 80 patients (88.75 % men) who had elective cabg surgery at the sklifosovsky research institute of emergency medicine. based on the development of af during the hospital stage of treatment (up to 10 days after cabg surgery), patients were divided into two groups. the group with af consisted of 19 patients, and the group without af consisted of 61 patients. all patients underwent electrocardiography (ecg), transthoracic echocardiography (echocg) with calculation of the left ventricular (lv) geometry type, and assessment of operational indexes. during surgery, biopsy of a part of the right atrial (ra) appendage was taken from 61 patients to verify the severity of myocardial fibrosis on a four-score scale where 0 is no interstitial fibrosis, 1 is slight fibrosis, 2 is moderate fibrosis, and 3 is severe fibrosis.results    all included patients had a low risk of developing postoperative complications according to the euroscore ii scale. according to echocg data, patients with af had significantly higher ratios of left ventricular myocardial mass to body surface area (lvmm / bsa) (p = 0.0006) and of left atrial volume to body surface area (la volume / bsa), p = 0.008). the distribution of patients by type of lv geometry was as follows: in the group with af, 52.63 % (n=10) of patients were diagnosed with concentric lv hypertrophy (lvh) whereas in the group without af, the majority of patients (83.60 %, n=51) had normal lv geometry and concentric lv remodeling (lvr) (p&lt;0.0001). according to the results of histological study, patients of the af group more frequently had moderate and severe interstitial fibrosis in the af appendage (p = 0.003). after multivariate regression and roc analysis, the predictive value remained for concentric lvh (p=0.002), lvmm / bsa ratio ≥97 g / m2 (p=0.006), la volume / bsa ratio ≥ 34.4 ml / m2 (p=0.04), and for ra appendage interstitial fibrosis score ≥2 (p=0.004). based on the identified predictors, a regression model was developed to predict the development of af at the hospital stage after cabg (p&lt;0.0001). the sensitivity and specificity of the model were 86.67 % and 78.26 %, respectively.conclusion    in patients at low perioperative risk, the lvmm / bsa ratio ≥97 g / m2, the la volume ratio / bsa ≥34.4 ml / m2, a ra appendage interstitial fibrosis score ≥2, and the presence of lvh were independent predictors of the development of af at the hospital stage after cabg operation.conclusion in patients at low perioperative risk, a lvmm / bsa ratio ≥97 g / m2, a la volume / bsa ratio ≥34.4 ml / m2, a ra appendage interstitial fibrosis score ≥2, and the presence of lvh were independent predictors of the development of af at the hospital stage after cabg."
38,38088079,"a rare case of isolated right atrial thrombus under anticoagulant therapy for atrial fibrillation is reported herein. the patient was an 81-year-old man undergoing anticoagulant therapy with oral warfarin for atrial fibrillation. during preoperative screening for eye surgery, echocardiography revealed a mobile mass in the right atrium, and emergency hospital admission was indicated. excision of the right atrial thrombus was performed, and no residual thrombus was detected on postoperative imaging studies. this case was considered a good indication for surgical resection because of potential risk of fatal embolism."
